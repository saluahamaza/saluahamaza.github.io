# Description

Students work in groups of ~10 on projects that deal with the topics of test, analysis & simulation. These projects are defined and supervised by academic staff from the Aerospace Faculty of the Delft University of Technology.
The work to be carried out by the group consists of at least the following activities:

1. Analysis of the data;
2. Verification of data analysis results through comparison with theory, simulations, and literature;
3. Interpretation of the results, resulting in conclusions with regards to the research question and recommendations;
4. Documentation of the research question, test, simulation and analysis results, and the conclusions in a scientific report;
5. Write a self-reflection. The student should reflect both on his/her technical input and functioning in the research group;
6. Peer review of reports as written by students from other groups.

Collecting the data is not a part of the project.
