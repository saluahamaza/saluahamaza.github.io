The Micro Air Vehicle Laboratory (MAVLab) of the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/) solves fundamental technological challenges of Micro Air Vehicles in order to maximize their utility and safety. It is part of the [Control and Simulation Section](https://cs.lr.tudelft.nl/) of the [Faculty of Aerospace Engineering](http://lr.tudelft.nl/).

Our goal is to put research into practice. We take the latest state-of-the-art theory and improve it until it can solve real-world problems.
