Biography
======
Salua Hamaza is Assistant Professor at the Micro Air Vehicles Lab (MAVLab) at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft. She received her PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the University of Bristol (UK) in 2019. Previously to the PhD in 2015, she was Research Engineer at the Robotics and Mechatronics Group (RAM) at University of Twente (NL), supervised by Prof. S. Stramigioli. During 2018 she was visiting PhD student at the  Group of Robotics, Vision and Control (GRVC) at the University of  Seville, supervised by Prof. A. Ollero. In 2019 she joined Imperial College London as PostDoc in the Aerial Robotics Laboratory, supervised by Prof. M. Kovac. To this day, she continues collaborating with the group at Imperial College as Guest Researcher.

Salua was awarded the IEEE Best RA-L Paper award at ICRA 2017. She ranked finalist in the 2019 edition of  Best UK PhD in Robotics Award, 2019 issued by Queen Mary University London, next to candidates from top UK Universities.

Expertise
======
Research interests are in two main areas: aerial physical interaction and embodied intelligence in aerial robots. Salua is interested in the design and morphology of aerial robots, and their implications in flight performance and stability during airborne interaction with the environment. Types of aerial interaction include: manipulating objects, contact inspection, perching and crawling with aerial robots.       
Recurring themes are mechanical compliance, design of actuators, compliant interaction control, kinematics and dynamics of multi-DoFs mechanisms for aerial robots, adaptive morphology, soft manipulation.
